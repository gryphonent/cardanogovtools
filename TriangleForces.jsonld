    "motivations": "Professionally, I have spent over three decades in the telecom, media, and digital entertainment industry. This experience has provided me with a deep understanding of the technical intricacies of decentralized systems, allowing me to navigate challenges and drive innovation. Additionally, I have a strong track record of leading diverse teams and fostering collaboration, which is essential for effective governance.\n\nOn a personal level, I am passionate about community building and have actively participated in various initiatives aimed at empowering individuals through technology. I want to leverage my skills and experiences to ensure that every voice in our community is heard and valued. Together, we can create a more inclusive and robust governance model for Cardano.",
    "objectives": "I firmly believe that Cardano stands out as the most perfectly decentralized PoS network, complete with a fixed supply and a disinflationary emissions schedule akin to Bitcoin. The combination of its innovative features—such as Leios, Hydra, Layer 2 solutions, and the unique UTxO accounting model—positions us for significant scaling across multiple fronts. There is no doubt in my mind about Cardano’s long-term potential in a better-connected world.\n\nAs we move forward, it is imperative for the Cardano community to adopt a business-minded approach. We must make decisive strategic choices that ensure the protocol's future stability while protecting our treasury and upholding the robust foundation rooted in scientific research.",
